These milestone extensions allow independent entities to come together and work as a team to deliver mission critical infrastructure services in a decentralized and affordable way. It allows members to receive payments for providing IaaS and allows those members to keep the majority of those payments. The member becomes a decentralized cloud provider of the program earning profits on the amortization of their hardware and services provided. The Network gets a resilient service that provides a better quality of service than those operated at major cloud infrastructure companies.

It will be necessary for the Administrative Curators and Janitorial Advisors to work together to determine an appropriate quantity of RPC endpoints per POP (“Point of Presence”) to allow additional members to join while not causing over-spend on the Treasury. For example, Europe is very dotsama heavy and will likely have an increased  number of members compared to those representing other regions. With so many POPs available it may be desirable to reduce the number of RPC endpoints operating in these locations. This has an overall effect of reducing the services provided from and payments to each member but also decreases the cost for the member. Another example, if there is a location, for instance, Portugal that is located in Europe but provides heavy connectivity for North Africa, it may be desirable to increase the number of RPC endpoints handled at that location.

Endpoint reductions come at the expense of resiliency of any individual POP. It is critical that no less than 2 RPC endpoints for every relay chain or para chain are online per POP to provide absolute minimum redundancy. Having a minimum number of endpoint services also provides a guaranteed minimum income to each member.

Various infrastructure software components will need to be developed to handle all of this activity which includes but is not limited to:

Decentralized telemetry endpoints
Telemetry endpoints allow access to see what nodes are online, what version of the software they’re running, and various other pieces of information necessary to verify that services were provided.
Decentralized connection logging
These are connection logs that allow the program to determine the number of connections and bandwidth transferred for a specific member. This allows us to map the network, connections processed, and determine any actions that may need to be taken to scale the network or make alterations to anycast communities.
Decentralized health checks
Decentralized health checks allow for members to independently and collectively determine if a member is fulfilling their duties according to the Service-Level-Agreements.

Because the program will inevitably have additional members join, reducing the overall payment per member we must find additional sources of revenue to offset the reduction in spending by the relay chain ecosystems. We believe that the Infrastructure Builders Program once deployed will provide a stepping stone for parachains to build similar programs requiring a specific milestone in the Infrastructure Builders Program to provide services in their program. Alternatively, There is the possibility that Administrative Curators and Janitorial Advisors can work with parachain teams to onboard the entire network to support their ecosystem. This additional source of revenue for the program would allow the member count to grow even further.
